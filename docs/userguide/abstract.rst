Abstract
========

In KVM4NFV project, we focus on the KVM hypervisor to enhance it for NFV,
by looking at the following areas initially-

* Minimal Interrupt latency variation for data plane VNFs:
   * Minimal Timing Variation for Timing correctness of real-time VNFs
   * Minimal packet latency variation for data-plane VNFs
* Inter-VM communication
* Fast live migration
