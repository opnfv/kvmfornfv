os-nosdn-kvm_nfv_ovs_dpdk_bar-ha Description
============================================

Introduction
-------------

.. In this section explain the purpose of the scenario and the
   types of capabilities provided

The purpose of os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha scenario testing is to test the
No High Availability deployment and configuration of OPNFV software suite
with OpenStack and without SDN software. This OPNFV software suite
includes OPNFV KVM4NFV latest software packages for Linux Kernel and
QEMU patches for achieving low latency.No High Availability feature is achieved
by deploying OpenStack multi-node setup with 1 controller and 3 computes nodes.

OPNFV Barometer packages is used for traffic,performance and platform monitoring.
KVM4NFV packages will be installed on compute nodes as part of deployment.
This scenario testcase deployment is happening on multi-node by using OPNFV Fuel deployer.

Scenario Components and Composition
------------------------------------
.. In this section describe the unique components that make up the scenario,
.. what each component provides and why it has been included in order
.. to communicate to the user the capabilities available in this scenario.

This scenario deploys the No High Availability OPNFV Cloud based on the
configurations provided in no-ha_nfv-kvm_nfv-ovs-dpdk-bar_heat_ceilometer_scenario.yaml.
This yaml file contains following configurations and is passed as an
argument to deploy.py script

* ``scenario.yaml:`` This configuration file defines translation between a
  short deployment scenario name(os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha) and an actual deployment
  scenario configuration file(no-ha_nfv-kvm_nfv-ovs-dpdk-bar_heat_ceilometer_scenario.yaml)

* ``deployment-scenario-metadata:`` Contains the configuration metadata like
  title,version,created,comment.

.. code:: bash

   deployment-scenario-metadata:
      title: NFV KVM and OVS-DPDK HA deployment
      version: 0.0.1
      created: Dec 20 2016
      comment: NFV KVM and OVS-DPDK

* ``stack-extensions:`` Stack extentions are opnfv added value features in form
  of a fuel-plugin.Plugins listed in stack extensions are enabled and
  configured. os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha scenario currently uses KVM-1.0.0 plugin and barometer-1.0.0 plugin.

.. code:: bash

  stack-extensions:
     - module: fuel-plugin-kvm
       module-config-name: fuel-nfvkvm
       module-config-version: 1.0.0
       module-config-override:
        # Module config overrides
     - module: fuel-plugin-collectd-ceilometer
       module-config-name: fuel-barometer
       module-config-version: 1.0.0
       module-config-override:
         # Module config overrides

* ``dea-override-config:`` Used to configure the HA mode,network segmentation
  types and role to node assignments.These configurations overrides
  corresponding keys in the dea_base.yaml and dea_pod_override.yaml.
  These keys are used to deploy multiple nodes(``1 controller,3 computes``)
  as mention below.

  * **Node 1**:
     - This node has MongoDB and Controller roles
     - The controller node runs the Identity service, Image Service, management portions of
       Compute and Networking, Networking plug-in and the dashboard
     - Uses VLAN as an interface

  * **Node 2**:
     - This node has compute and Ceph-osd roles
     - Ceph is a massively scalable, open source, distributed storage system
     - By default, Compute uses KVM as the hypervisor
     - Uses DPDK as an interface

  * **Node 3**:
     - This node has compute and Ceph-osd roles
     - Ceph is a massively scalable, open source, distributed storage system
     - By default, Compute uses KVM as the hypervisor
     - Uses DPDK as an interface

  * **Node 4**:
     - This node has compute and Ceph-osd roles
     - Ceph is a massively scalable, open source, distributed storage system
     - By default, Compute uses KVM as the hypervisor
     - Uses DPDK as an interface

  The below is the ``dea-override-config`` of the no-ha_nfv-kvm_nfv-ovs-dpdk-bar_heat_ceilometer_scenario.yaml file.

* ``dha-override-config:`` Provides information about the VM definition and
  Network config for virtual deployment.These configurations overrides
  the pod dha definition and points to the controller,compute and
  fuel definition files. The noha_nfv-kvm_nfv-ovs-dpdk-bar_heat_ceilometer_scenario.yaml has no dha-config changes i.e., default    configuration is used.

* os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha scenario is successful when all the 4 Nodes are accessible,
  up and running.



**Note:**

* In os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha scenario, OVS is installed on the compute nodes with DPDK configured

* Baraometer plugin is also implemented along with KVM plugin.

* Hugepages for DPDK are configured in the attributes_1 section of the no-ha_nfv-kvm_nfv-ovs-dpdk_heat_ceilometer_scenario.yaml

* Hugepages are only configured for compute nodes

* This results in faster communication and data transfer among the compute nodes

Scenario Usage Overview
-----------------------
.. Provide a brief overview on how to use the scenario and the features available to the
.. user.  This should be an "introduction" to the userguide document, and explicitly link to it,
.. where the specifics of the features are covered including examples and API's

* The high availability feature is disabled and deploymet is done by deploy.py with
  noha_nfv-kvm_nfv-ovs-dpdk-bar_heat_ceilometer_scenario.yaml as an argument.
* Install Fuel Master and deploy OPNFV Cloud from scratch on Hardware
  Environment:


Command to deploy the os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha scenario:

.. code:: bash

        $ cd ~/fuel/ci/
        $ sudo ./deploy.sh -f -b file:///tmp/opnfv-fuel/deploy/config -l devel-pipeline -p default -s no-ha_nfv-kvm_nfv-ovs-dpdk-bar_heat_ceilometer_scenario.yaml -i file:///tmp/opnfv.iso

where,
    -b is used to specify the configuration directory

    -i is used to specify the image downloaded from artifacts.

Note:

.. code:: bash

          Check $ sudo ./deploy.sh -h for further information.

* os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha scenario can be executed from the jenkins project
  "fuel-os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha-baremetal-daily-master"
* This scenario provides the No High Availability feature by deploying
  1 controller,3 compute nodes and checking if all the 4 nodes
  are accessible(IP,up & running).
* Test Scenario is passed if deployment is successful and all 4 nodes have
  accessibility (IP , up & running).

Known Limitations, Issues and Workarounds
-----------------------------------------
.. Explain any known limitations here.

* Test scenario os-nosdn-kvm_ovs_dpdk_bar-noha result is not stable.
