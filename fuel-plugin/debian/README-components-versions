Evolution of qemu-related packages in debian

kvm: was a binary package providing /usr/bin/kvm before squeeze.

 In squeeze it has been renamed to qemu-kvm,
 so kvm becomes a transitional package.

 Probably can be get rid of now.

 No need to conflict with this package, but we can force-remove it
 by conflicting with it.

 Some packages may still Require/Depend/Suggest: kvm.


qemu-kvm: was a binary package providing /usr/bin/kvm in wheezy (v. 1.1)

 This binary become a (deprecated) shell wrapper and was a part of
 qemu-system-x86 package between versions 1.3.0+dfsg-5 (when qemu-system
 were split) up to 1.7.0+dfsg-1, with qemu-kvm package being transitional.

 At version 1.7.0+dfsg-2, qemu-kvm packcage is not transitional anymore,
 and the wrapper is provided by qemu-kvm, not qemu-system-x86.

 Some packages may Require/Depend/Suggest: qemu-kvm.

qemu: initially it was a mix of all of qemu (unrelated, not conflicting
with qemu-kvm or kvm)

 at 0.11.0-1 it were split to qemu-user, qemu-user-static and qemu-system.

 Also qemu-keymaps is made a separate package at version 0.12.4+dfsg-4
 (for use together with qemu-kvm and xen and, on ubuntu, qemu-linaro).

 And qemu-utils become a separate package (look when? since the beginning?)

 Now it is a metapackage and a placeholder for some docs

qemu-system: was a package with all qemu-system-* binaries.

 Were split into individual qemu-system-foo and qemu-system-common at version
 1.3.0+dfsg-5, so qemu-system becomes a metapackage without its own files.

 The split introduced a bunch of qemu-system-* conflicting+replacing
 qemu-system<<1.3.0+dfsg-5.

 At version 1.3.0+dfsg-4exp (before split, in experimental), /usr/bin/kvm was
 a part of qemu-system (and later qemu-system-x86)/

 At the same version, virtfs-proxy-helper binary has been moved from qemu-utils
 to qemu-system (and later to qemu-system-common).

qemu-system-common: appeared at 1.3.0+dfsg-5, files common for all qemu-system*

 briefly (>=1.3.0+dfsg-4exp, <<1.3.0+dfsg-5), qemu-utils had
 virtfs-proxy-helper binary which is in qemu-system-common

qemu-keymaps: keymap definition for qemu, qemu-kvm and xen.

 Can be merged into qemu-system-common now, or after qemu-linaro.

 Were split out of qemu at version 0.12.4+dfsg-4

qemu-utils: common utilities (part of qemu-common in ubuntu?)

 In versions between 1.3.0+dfsg-1~exp1 and 1.3.0+dfsg-4exp, wrongly shipped
 virtfs-proxy-helper binary

qemu-user, qemu-user-static: user-mode qemu emulation

 Were split out of qemu at verson 0.11.0-1 (pre-squeeze),
 do not conflict/replace anything anymore.

qemu-common: ubuntu package
