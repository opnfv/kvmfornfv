Scripts that sometimes ask questions are even worse.  You don\u0027t need this check at all, trust the user to know when the config file has changed and the user can act accordingly",

So if any script want to use this, it should be ok to simply passing -f/-n parameter.\n\nSometimes we are trying some new config, and we forgot the last changes or, changed too much and may forgot one.
