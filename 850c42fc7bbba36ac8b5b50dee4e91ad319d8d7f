      "message": "Hi, Swati, I think this document is for end user and thus it should be from end user point of view. While currently it\u0027s more from CICD point of view.\n\nIMHO, we can take the installation from two point of view. We can talk about how to install from source code, and we can also talk about how to install from fuel installer.\n\nFor build from source code, the key point is talk about the interface/usage of the ci/build.sh , and then , shortly tell them to check release document like CentOS or Ubuntu document on how to install the package and reboot the system. You can reuse  most of the material here.\n\nFor install from fuel, just asking them to refer to Fuel document.\n\nAny idea?",
