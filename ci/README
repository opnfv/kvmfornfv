The "ci" folder consists of-

build.sh  --> builds rpm packages (if first argument passed as "rpm") by calling build_rpm subfolder files ; builds debian packages (if first argument passed as "debian") by calling build_deb subfolder files; builds both debian and rpm packages (if No first argument is passed)
build_deb --> contains the files required to build debian backages for kernel and qemu, inside ubuntu docker
build_rpm --> contains the files required to build rpm backages for kernel and qemu, inside centos docker
envs      --> contains the host and guest setup+configuration files.
