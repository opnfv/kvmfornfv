The "ci" folder consists of-

build.sh --> builds rpm packages (if -p package option is  passed as "centos"
or in default case) by calling build_interface.sh and build_rpm subfolder
files ; builds debian packages (if -p package option is  passed as "ubuntu")
by calling build_interface.sh and build_deb subfolder files;
builds both debian and rpm packages (if -p package option is
passed as "both").

build_interface.sh --> triggers qemu_build.sh and kernel_build.sh

build_deb --> contains the Dockerfile required to build debian backages for
kernel and qemu, inside ubuntu docker.

build_rpm --> contains the Dockerfile required to build rpm backages for
kernel and qemu, inside centos docker.

envs --> contains the host and guest setup+configuration files.
