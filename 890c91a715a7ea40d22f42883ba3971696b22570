In the end, tar ball the log directory and upload to the artifactory repo. \n\nOr, if we want to keep the kvmfornfv_trace_log, then we create another layer between build_output and the kvmfornfv_trace_log, so that the program that tar ball the log files can simply tar ball one directory.\n\nYour idea?",
