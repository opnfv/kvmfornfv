      "message": "This is a config file instead of script, so I think it\u0027s OK for hard coded specifier.If end user want to use, they can provide their value.\n\nOf course, we can do the work better. For example, we can have the script to detect the platform\u0027s CPU structure and NUMA, and use some algorithm to calculate the to-be-isolated CPUs. But that\u0027s too much for this simple work, especially if we plan to run our test on fixed environemnt, like always on one PoD.",
