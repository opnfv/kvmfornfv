qemu-system for Debian
----------------------

The qemu-system-ppc package does not include the video.x file, which is 
needed by qemu-system-ppc for some systems. The file is available from
the mac-on-linux project, and the sources are available on:
  http://mac-on-linux.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mac-on-linux/mac-drivers/video_driver/Makefile?revision=HEAD&view=markup

They are not buildable on a Debian system though, hence video.x is not
present in the package. The qemu-system-ppc binary is still useful for
emulating a PReP platform, which does not need video.x.
