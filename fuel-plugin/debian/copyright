This package was debianized by Paul Russell <prussell@debian.org> on

Then maintained as part of the team by:

    Guilherme de S. Pastore <gpastore@debian.org>
    Elrond <elrond@samba-tng.org>
    Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>

Now maintained as a team by:

    Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>
    Michael Tokarev <mjt@tls.msk.ru>
    Riku Voipio <riku@debian.org>
    Vagrant Cascadian <vagrant@debian.org>

The upstream source was downloaded from:

    git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git

    All the binary blobs without sources contained in the pc-bios/ directory
    (*.dtb, *.bin, *rom, openbios-*, palcode-clipper) in the original upstream 
    git repository have been removed starting from Debian package version 
    0.6.0.dfsg.1-1. Those roms which are free can be found in split packages 
    of their own, represented accordingly in the dependency relationships.
